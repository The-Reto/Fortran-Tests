# Fortran-Tests
Four small FORTRAN programms I worte. Maybe usefull as examples, I doubt they can be used for anything else.
1. Hello World - literally a "Hello World" program
2. Pi - four different algorithms to approximate Pi
3. Fibonacci - An exercise in recursive functions, outputting the fibonacci sequence
4. Mandelbrot - Outputs an ASCII version of the famous mandelbrot set, allows you to zoom and move around.
